The objective of this project is to port the ZLib general purpose compression library to a Microsoft Windows 7 (x86 & x86-64) compile environment in which no errors or warnings are generated by the compiler.

Compiling the source, at the time and date of the start of this project and as downloaded from http://www.zlib.net (v.1.2.7), does not seem to compile for an x64 target in MSVS 2008 without errors. Rather than just hacking a patch into the code, the objective with this project is to fully update the code to a point in which the Microsoft compiler does not generate any warnings or errors.

The output of this build can then be used for other Windows x86-64 projects.

Source code downloads must now either be downloaded from the "Source" tab at the top of the page, or from External links section on the left-side of the page.
